Assignment: This assignment   is   based on the analytics tasks   in Tableau   completed   in   seminars   during the   module   as well as the   requirement for you to complete   the   Python   module   from   datacamp below.
https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science 
The aim   is for you to   build   up   a   personal   portfolio of completed   tasks that   show   you developing skills. We want you to   build the confidence   to   develop   your   own   solutions to data   manipulation   and communication tasks   as well as your technical   skills   in   Excel,   Python   and Tableau.   Developing these skills will allow you to   contribute to   the   group   assessment task   in full. 
The five Tableau seminars will start with   basic Tableau   analytics tasks   and   will   build   up   to   complex dashboards and data stories. This   will   be   a   learning journey for   you   and   this assignment will   help you   record and   reflect on your   progress.   Each task will   be   handed   out   before the seminar, and you will   have a   chance   during   the   seminar   and   afterwards   to develop   and   refine your own work.   For each task we   will   be   using   the   Tableau   software   that      forms the core of the   module’s technical content   and you   should   provide   a   link   to   your   work   by   uploading   it to the tableau   public gallery. 
In your   portfolio we will   require you to   provide a   short   reflection   on   what you   learned undertaking the task, the strengths and weaknesses of your   solution   and   how   the   skills developed   may   be   used   in   other tasks. This will   also   include   reflections on the   programming   language   Python as well as   work with   Excel. 
You will   be   required to   reflect on your   use of Tableau verbally   in   a   seminar   and this   will   form   part of the   assessment criteria. 
Module Learning Outcomes: 
In this assessment the following   learning outcomes will   be   covered   :
•         Select, apply, and   evaluate common   analytics techniques   and   implement   them   using   appropriate software tools.
